	<p> This is a game that I created inspired by a philosophy book called Zhuangzi. A classmate of mine, Charles Ta, illustrated a comic of a short phrase from the book. The comic examines envy,the futileness of it as everyone has their own unique abilities, their own "heavenly impulse". I had a lot of fun in the discussions, and I wanted to display the concepts that we'd converse about through a digital medium. I wanted to transform the story and the characters  in it, composing it into a game to display the different perspectives from editing the point of view for each animal/object on Unity.

    <p> Perhaps this short phrase from the book can demonstrate the philosophical ideas. “A small consciousness cannot keep up with a vast consciousness; short duration cannot keep up with long duration. How do we know? The morning mushroom knows nothing of the noontide; the winter cicada knows nothing of the spring and autumn. This is what is meant by short duration.” (1:6)</p> </div>

    To manipulate different perspectives, I changed the sound, movement, camera perspective, and effects through post-processing for every character. Each character has their own unique characteristics. For example, the wind has a blue and foggy filter, with swooshing sounds in the background when you travel towards the next character. When you’re close to the next character, a text will pop up asking you if you want to become them because of their own unique abilities.
