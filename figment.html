Figment is a first-person immersive experience. I used to have a habit of writing my dreams on a notebook or my phone every morning I wake up. Most of the time, they stick with me visually if I write them down. Some nights, my dreams are very usual, some nights they’re odd and eccentric, and some nights they can be fantastical and breathtaking. Most of my dreams are connected to something I’ve seen or some thought process I’ve had earlier in the day, but what amuses me is how our brains process that information and twists them. Things I can never consciously think of when I’m awake but see in my dream, and I wonder how does that even biologically work? Things that are figmental have always enraptured me because of the beauty it embodies. Some of my dreams include Socrates being baptized (the first picture), being stranded on an island, and having a big fish chasing after me.
