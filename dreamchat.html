	<p>DreamChat is a dream-sharing network where users can share their dreams to the public or to their friends through private / public threads. There are two aspects, “words”, which is the creative writing aspect, and “visuals”, which is the artistic aspect. The purpose of this is to encourage artists (creative writers, visual artists) to transform their dreams into art for inspiration by sharing and even collaborating together. From this, users also have the ability to interpret each other’s dreams, seeking meaning, or purely for playfulness. My website is not only engaged with people who have crazy visuals in their dreams, but people who are interested in dream analysis/interpretation, or people who simply want to turn their imagination from their dreams into art. Creating art that is only related to dreams is very specific, so I do believe that this website excludes people who do not have an interest in it. <br> <br>
          Apparently, in ancient Egypt, “dreams were among the items recorded in the form of hieroglyphics.” There were even priests that served as dream interpreters. But dream interpretation was no longer popular until Freud brought it back for a while. But now, it’s not as popular as it was before. So I wanted to bring this back by creating a social network.
Furthermore, I asked a variation of people of what their dreams feel like to them or what they dream of, and got many different answers. Some say “It feels like I’m jumping from one place to another”, “I simply never remember them”, “they’re intensely vivid and surreal”, “I feel my mood changing, I sometimes cry when I wake up”, or “they’re just based off of real life events”. I wanted to use these descriptions to construct the user experience (for example: the click or hover for text).

       I tried to conduct a small research to see what it would be like analyzing each other’s dreams, and see the distinction in imagining someone else’s dream as yourself. What I realized is when another person tries to interpret the other person's dream, it is almost impossible to completely feel what the person who had the dream feels and sees. Of course, this is obvious, but it shows how creating a 3D environment can be strong, and how working collaboratively can make things get real interesting.
