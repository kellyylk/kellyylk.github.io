        My research topic is based on how 5G plays an important role in the development of healthcare. Many of my sources discuss how 5G is vital to “smart hospitals” and innovative healthcare technologies because of the low latency that 5G provides machine learning or artificial intelligence. <br>One of my primary sources include a video that explains the function of IOT Robotic Surgery and how its heavily reliant on low latency. Furthermore, I was also speculating the cons to 5G as well as to this surgical device. If this cellular network is improved, it can also benefit hackers making things easier for them. If this robotic surgical device is also used as a practice in hospitals, hackers can tamper with it thus causing many issues for patients leaving doctors helpless. Therefore for my 2D Study, I wanted to present a dichotomy of “utopia” and “dystopia”. <br> I wanted to display both the pros and cons, how certain people have a fallacy of how technology is the solution to creating the “perfect world”, while there can also be many issues that aren’t talked about or exposed enough to the public.  out or exposed enough to the public.

This 3D study was to further develop on how 5G plays a vital role in the development of healthcare, how it supports Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence and what it can create out of those innovative technologies. My 2D Study explored the dichotomy of “utopia” and “dystopia” of how technology has its pros and cons while people believe it can build a “perfect world”. What I got out of my 2D Study was the critical research of the political issues going on and the bans that I missed out. Huawei is banned because the American government believes that there can be a threat to all countries due to the “espionage” because of the new law in China (at least that's the reason they want the public to believe). I delve into making an abstract prosthetic leg that is powered by 5G, along with a personal healthcare data storage device that gives you personal customized surgery systems to insert into other machines. Hypothetically, the leg is able to change the speed from movement, adjusting according to the location you’re in. But the leg itself is an abstract artifact, having sharp and fragile edges resembling danger of “espionage” and exposure in privacy.</p>
